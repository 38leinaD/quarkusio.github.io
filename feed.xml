We just released Quarkus 0.22.0 including an improved Spring API support.


We also officially launch code.quarkus.io: it has never been easier to create a Quarkus application.

Quarkus live coding (aka dev mode) is really useful for applications that mix front end or services and database access.
There are a few common approaches to make the best of it.


The first choice is to use quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=drop-and-create in conjunction with import.sql.
That way for every change to your app and in particular to your entities, the database schema will...

An important part of any software project, Quarkus applications included, is continuous integration. A popular
tool in the CI space is CircleCI, especially with open source projects. There is lots
of documentation out there about how to configure CircleCI for a standard Maven project. However, building a native
Quarkus executable requires one or two extra steps. This blog post describes how ...

If you use Quarkus with GraalVM to build native executables, Quarkus 0.20.0 now requires GraalVM 19.1.1 so please upgrade your GraalVM installation.

Quarkus ArC is a build-time oriented dependency injection based on CDI 2.0.
In this blogpost, we&#8217;re going to explain the relationship to the specification and describe some of the benefits and drawbacks of the build-time processing design.

We just released Quarkus 0.19.1.


This new version brings a lot of new extensions, especially in the persistence area.









Quarkus 0.19.1 is still targeting GraalVM 19.0.2 as we discovered a bug in GraalVM 19.1.0 that affects Quarkus.


The issue is already fixed but we are waiting for a 19.1.1 release.

This the first part of a blog series that delves deeper into Quarkus performance.  There are many aspects to the performance of a framework from bootstrap time to memory usage, compile time and runtime performance.


The definition of "performance" is contextual and these series of blog posts aims to investigate the performance of Quarkus in varying contexts.

Quarkus 0.18.0 was just released and is now available on Maven Central.


We usually release Quarkus every two weeks and it has just been a week since our last release so why release 0.18.0 so soon?
Well, we have some good news to share: Quarkus now supports GraalVM 19 (requires it, even) and we wanted to put this version in your hands as quickly as possible.
