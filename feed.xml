                I got an interesting question from a user about Redis and Mutiny. While the problem was not specifically about Redis and could be applied to many other APIs, I found the context amusing. Enrico, the user, wanted to do something like this: 1. get all keys from Redis 2. for...

                The Quarkus project moves fast and when we prepare bugfix releases, we usually have several dozens of pull requests to backport. The number of pull requests to backport is enormous and doing it via the GitHub UI is inconvenient and takes a lot of time (click PR, copy/paste commit hashes...

            <description>
                In the past week, I got several questions about failure handling with Mutiny. So, maybe it deserves a bit more explanation. Failures are events First, Mutiny is an event-driven reactive programming library. With Mutiny, you handle events. An upstream Uni or Multi propagates these events and gives you the possibility...

Of course, you can pick extensions which are going to be...
