                Since its first release, Quarkus lets you create resilient applications with MicroProfile Fault Tolerance. It uses SmallRye Fault Tolerance to provide this functionality. At the time SmallRye Fault Tolerance was born, Hystrix was still a thing and was chosen to be the core of the implementation. The choice turned out...

                Quarkus is still young and thus it might come as a surprise to some there are actually already a good amount of Quarkus support in most of the various IDE&#8217;s.
