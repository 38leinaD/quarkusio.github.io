Just a few days after 0.24.0, and to stay in line with our planning, we release 0.25.0.


This release fixes a couple of issues, mostly related to the new HTTP layer and brings some updates to the currently being rewritten security layer.


What&#8217;s new?


Security layer changes

HTTP based permissions can now be defined in the application.properties.


This new feature is fully documented...

Last week in a hotel room in Boston I managed to get Jason, Emmanuel and Bill from the Quarkus team to sit down and record episode #46 of JBoss Asylum.


The episode is called "Quarkus to the bones" where we all four go into the details on the why and how on how Quarkus was created and what it is good for - all while having a bit of fun.


The episode is posted on JBoss Community Asylum and al...

Due to serious outages of the OSS Sontype (our gate to Maven Central), we were unable to release as planned but&#8230;&#8203; here we are, 0.24.0 is out!


This one is built on top of the shoulders of 0.23 to move more things to our new Vert.x based HTTP layer. It also introduces big changes to our security layer.


What&#8217;s new?


Servlet no longer required for JAX-RS

This means that if ...

Last week, we released Quarkus 0.23.1 which paved the way towards our new Vert.x based HTTP layer and brought a lot of new features (see the original announcement post for all the details).
We discovered a memory usage regression shortly after the release: it was not a memory leak or anything that bad but an increased memory usage due to Netty getting a bit too comfortable.


Today, we release...

DO NOT USE 0.23.1 - PLEASE USE 0.23.2.


We found a major memory regression in 0.23.1, we urge you to not use it and use 0.23.2 instead.






We just released Quarkus 0.23.1.
This version is an important milestone for us as it materializes one of our major objectives: relying on Vert.x for our entire HTTP layer.
It also comes with a lot of improvements and bugfixes contributed by our v...

Earlier this year, we have been introduced to Quarkus, the next-generation, container-first framework for Java applications.
As expected, such new frameworks and technologies make way for new developer tools focused on making
the development experience even better.
The recent Quarkus Tools for Visual Studio Code release
aims to do just that,
by bringing features specific to Quarkus project dev...
