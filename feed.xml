GoWithFlow, a recent startup based out of Portugal, a spin-off from CEiiA with Galp as a majority shareholder, provides integrated mobility solutions that can both provision end-to-end services to new mobility operators (eg. running a scooter-sharing network, managing an EV charging network, managing a fleet), but also gather data from other mobility operators, e.g.car-sharing operators...

Keeping the rapid pace of one release per week, here comes Quarkus 0.26.1.


Thanks a lot to the community at large for the useful bug reports, that helps a lot in stabilizing the new HTTP and security layers. Keep them coming.


Apart from bugfixes, the new big thing in 0.26.1 is an extension adding support for HashiCorp Vault.

Just a few days after 0.24.0, and to stay in line with our planning, we release 0.25.0.


This release fixes a couple of issues, mostly related to the new HTTP layer and brings some updates to the currently being rewritten security layer.

Last week in a hotel room in Boston I managed to get Jason, Emmanuel and Bill from the Quarkus team to sit down and record episode #46 of JBoss Asylum.


The episode is called "Quarkus to the bones" where we all four go into the details on the why and how on how Quarkus was created and what it is good for - all while having a bit of fun.


The episode is posted on JBoss Community Asylum and al...

Due to serious outages of the OSS Sontype (our gate to Maven Central), we were unable to release as planned but&#8230;&#8203; here we are, 0.24.0 is out!


This one is built on top of the shoulders of 0.23 to move more things to our new Vert.x based HTTP layer. It also introduces big changes to our security layer.

Last week, we released Quarkus 0.23.1 which paved the way towards our new Vert.x based HTTP layer and brought a lot of new features (see the original announcement post for all the details).
We discovered a memory usage regression shortly after the release: it was not a memory leak or anything that bad but an increased memory usage due to Netty getting a bit too comfortable.


Today, we release...
