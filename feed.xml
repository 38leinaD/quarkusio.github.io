DO NOT USE 0.23.1 - THERE IS A MAJOR REGRESSION!


We found a major memory regression in 0.23.1, we urge you to not use it and fall back to 0.22 if you have moved already






We just released Quarkus 0.23.1.
This version is an important milestone for us as it materializes one of our major objectives: relying on Vert.x for our entire HTTP layer.
It also comes with a lot of improvements...

Earlier this year, we have been introduced to Quarkus, the next-generation, container-first framework for Java applications.
As expected, such new frameworks and technologies make way for new developer tools focused on making
the development experience even better.
The recent Quarkus Tools for Visual Studio Code release
aims to do just that,
by bringing features specific to Quarkus project dev...

Quarkus live coding (aka dev mode) is really useful for applications that mix front end or services and database access.
There are a few common approaches to make the best of it.


The first choice is to use quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=drop-and-create in conjunction with import.sql.
That way for every change to your app and in particular to your entities, the database schema will...

An important part of any software project, Quarkus applications included, is continuous integration. A popular
tool in the CI space is CircleCI, especially with open source projects. There is lots
of documentation out there about how to configure CircleCI for a standard Maven project. However, building a native
Quarkus executable requires one or two extra steps. This blog post describes how ...

If you use Quarkus with GraalVM to build native executables, Quarkus 0.20.0 now requires GraalVM 19.1.1 so please upgrade your GraalVM installation.

Quarkus ArC is a build-time oriented dependency injection based on CDI 2.0.
In this blogpost, we&#8217;re going to explain the relationship to the specification and describe some of the benefits and drawbacks of the build-time processing design.

We just released Quarkus 0.19.1.


This new version brings a lot of new extensions, especially in the persistence area.









Quarkus 0.19.1 is still targeting GraalVM 19.0.2 as we discovered a bug in GraalVM 19.1.0 that affects Quarkus.


The issue is already fixed but we are waiting for a 19.1.1 release.
