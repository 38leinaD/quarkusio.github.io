                The Quarkus project moves fast and when we prepare bugfix releases, we usually have several dozens of pull requests to backport. The number of pull requests to backport is enormous and doing it via the GitHub UI is inconvenient and takes a lot of time (click PR, copy/paste commit hashes...

If you did, then you might have wondered why, with the breadth of Quarkus extensions, we would only let you generate a REST API example application. Of course, you can pick extensions which are going to be...
