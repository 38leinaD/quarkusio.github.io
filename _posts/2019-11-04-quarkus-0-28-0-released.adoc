This release is a bugfix/usability improvements release so the upgrade from 0.27.0 should be safe.

Thus, no big changes to announce.

== What's new?

=== Guides and quickstarts URLs changes

Our guides URLs and our quickstarts directories were not entirely consistent until now. We changed them for more consistency.

We put redirections in place for the guides but we can't do it for the quickstarts directories so if you encounter any broken links on the website, please report them and we'll fix them right away.

Thanks!
